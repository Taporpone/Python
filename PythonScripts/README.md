# PythonScripts

Collection of stand alone scripts written in Python.
Some come from early times of me playing with Python - syntax and logic might not always be Pythonic.

* PS_password_generator - Generates a password and copies it to clipboard (on OSX at least). Run with *python PS_password_generator*. Hit enter for a quick pass that consist of chars, specials and numbers or  *m* for more options.

* PS_tpb_scrapper - Scrpit goes to TOR TPB HS (by default) or clearnet TPB and scrapps results of provided search. Returned result consists of: filename, filesize and magnet link. To access TPB HS please run through torify - *torify python PS_tpb_scrapper*.
* PS_numbers_to_words - Converts digits (*123*) from 0 to 10.000 to words (*one hundred three*).
* PS_qrcode_gen - Creats QR code based on user input. SVG file is saved to wherever the script resides.
